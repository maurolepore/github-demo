Demo Git, GitHub and RStudio

Meet Mauro at https://appear.in/fgeo or let him know where else.

[Setup](https://github.com/maurolepore/github-demo/issues/1)

## 1. Setup

We'll be working with Git + GitHub + RStudio. This truly requires your attention before our meeting. Iwant to show you how to use Git/GitHub in your life as an R-using data analyst, which means we can't afford to get bogged down in a hot mess of Git installation issues. Let's try to work through them beforehand.

Do what's listed here: https://happygitwithr.com/workshops.html#pre-workshop-set-up
